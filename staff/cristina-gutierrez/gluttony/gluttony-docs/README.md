# H2 Description

Gluttony is a mobile-oriented app purposed on searching the nearest bar or restaurant using your own geolocation. The purpose of this app is to make leisure's people more useful. Sometimes when you travel to an unknown city, you ignore where the catering establishments could be. Or maybe, you are in your own city and you want to drink or eat something, but you don't want to think where.

With Gluttony, you can easily search the nearest bar or restaurant - you just have to press a button and follow the map. You can see information about the establishment. To make things more comfortable, you can do this without signing up. But if you do, you`ll can write comments about the establishments and have a list of your favourites.
