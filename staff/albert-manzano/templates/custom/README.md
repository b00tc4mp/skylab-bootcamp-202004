I took the liberty to make an additional README in order to explain this humble project.

As you probably saw i upladed alse 1 picture and few icons, if the file it is too heavy, kindly let me know. The reason why  i did this was to show the main interface of my website.

No hrefs were attached to the links, yet.

I added a Js file to add 3 events, to my costumized website:
    -submit: i does not really submit anything, will pop out the main text.
    -hamburger:will display a side navbar.
    -X (inside the side navbar): will close this secondary menu.

If there is anything related to the layout i could imrpove, please let me know so i can keep improving this website.

Cheers!
