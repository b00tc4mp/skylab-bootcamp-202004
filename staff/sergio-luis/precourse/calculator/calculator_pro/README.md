- The program must contemplate and inform the user in the event that the user enters anything other than numbers.
- If the user enters a single number, they should show ONLY their square root.
- The results should be stored inside an array and displayed in a user friendly way.

 ```javascript
results = [num1 + num2 = resultSum, num1 - num2 = resultRest, ...]
 ```
 
 - After doing all the operations, the program should ask the user if they want to carry out another operation, storing more results again and displaying them.
