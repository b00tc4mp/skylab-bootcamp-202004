# CooHappy

Your app to organize your cohousing

Cohappy is born to make co-housing easier. I got the idea while taking part of “cohousing Barcelona”, a cooperative developed for hosting, and notice the big need for a mobile app in this sector, as there is still so little. So, with not much more to say, I putted together an alternative of app solution for this market not yet explored.
